# Moneyball

This project aims to analyze Major League Baseball (MLB) data to evaluate return on investment (ROI) at both the team and individual player levels. Inspired by the Moneyball methodology, the goal is to calculate how efficiently teams convert payroll into wins, and how players contribute relative to their salaries. The insights generated will assist sports analysts and general managers in making data-driven decisions about player acquisitions and team-building strategies.
