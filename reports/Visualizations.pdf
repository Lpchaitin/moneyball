For this project, I created the following visualizations in Looker Studio to analyze MLB team performance, 
payroll trends, and return on investment (ROI):

Total Wins vs. Payroll (Scatterplot)
Displays the relationship between team payroll and total wins across seasons, 
identifying whether higher spending correlates with better performance.

Summary of Key Statistics (Table with Heat Map)
Presents wins, losses, win percentage, total payroll, 
and payroll per win by team and season. The heat map highlights significant variations in each metric.

Average Payroll Per Win by Year (Line Chart)
Tracks how much teams spent per win over time, 
revealing trends in spending efficiency or inefficiency across seasons.

Average Team Payroll (Bar Chart)
Compares the average payroll by team over the dataset period, 
spotlighting consistently high or low spending franchises.

Average Wins by Team (Bar Chart)
Shows the average number of wins per team, 
offering insights into long-term team performance regardless of payroll.

Most Wins and Losses by a Team in a Season (Table)
Lists the highest and lowest single-season win and loss records, 
identifying outlier team performances.

Total Losses by Team (Treemap)
Visualizes the cumulative losses by team across all seasons, 
with size and color indicating total losses, highlighting consistently struggling teams.
