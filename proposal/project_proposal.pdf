Project Name
Moneyball ROI Analysis: Evaluating Team and Player Value in Major League Baseball

Project Description
This project aims to analyze Major League Baseball (MLB) data to evaluate return on investment (ROI) at both the team and individual player levels. Inspired by the Moneyball methodology, the goal is to calculate how efficiently teams convert payroll into wins, and how players contribute relative to their salaries. The insights generated will assist sports analysts and general managers in making data-driven decisions about player acquisitions and team-building strategies.

Tech Stack
SQL (PostgreSQL on AWS RDS)
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Tableau or Power BI for visualization

Recommended Certifications
SQL for Data Science (Coursera)
Python for Data Analysis (DataCamp)
Tableau Desktop Specialist

Objectives
Quantify team ROI by calculating payroll per win across MLB franchises.
Calculate individual player ROI by comparing salaries to performance metrics (e.g., WAR, batting stats).
Identify undervalued and overpaid players to support strategic roster decisions.
Deliver insights through clear, impactful data visualizations.

Timeline
Day 1: Extract and clean MLB salary and performance data using SQL and Python.
Day 2: Calculate ROI metrics and perform comparative analysis.
Day 3: Build interactive dashboards to visualize findings and support recommendations.

Evaluation Criteria
Success will be assessed based on:
Accuracy of ROI calculations and derived metrics.
Business relevance of the insights provided.
Quality and clarity of visualizations and storytelling.

Steps to Completion
Extract team and player salary data (web scrape or Kaggle dataset).
Extract player and team performance data from an API (e.g., SportsDataIO or MLB API).
Clean, merge, and store datasets in an AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance.
Calculate team and player ROI metrics.
Conduct descriptive and diagnostic SQL analysis.
Visualize trends and outliers using Tableau or Power BI dashboards.

Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
Data Integration: Merging performance and payroll data from different formats.
Mitigation: Design consistent schemas and use SQL joins effectively.
Data Gaps: Incomplete salary or performance records.
Mitigation: Use available proxies or limit analysis to complete entries.
Visualization Interpretation: Ensuring stakeholders can act on visual outputs.
Mitigation: Use filters, tooltips, and story dashboards in Tableau for clarity.
